val add_resume_hook : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit
(** [add_resume_hook f] adds [f] in the list of functions to be called
    on resume. *)

(** [add_suspend_hook f] adds [f] in the list of functions to be called
    before suspend *)

val shutdown: reason -> unit
(** [shutdown reason] informs Xen that the unikernel has shutdown. The
    [reason] argument indicates the type of shutdown (according to
    this type and the configuration of the unikernel, Xen might
    restart the unikernel or not). To suspend, do a [shutdown Suspend]
    is not enough, use the function below instead. *)

val suspend: unit -> int Lwt.t
(** [suspend ()] suspends the unikernel and returns [0] after
    the kernel has been resumed, in case of success, or
    immediately returns a non-zero value in case of error. *)
